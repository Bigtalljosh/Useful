# In Refinement:

* Do I have enough info?
* Do I have a solution?
* Can I estimate?
* Am I confident in the work to be done?

These are in order, one leads into the next. If you can't answer them all the PBI is not ready for sprint planning.
We can task it out at the refinement level too, once all the questions are answered. 

If you have enough info you should be able to come up with a solution.
If you can't come up with a solution, you likely don't have enough info.
If you have a solution you should be able to break it down into tasks and estimate it. 
If you don't have confidence in the solution, you likely have some known unknowns or not enough info to come up a comprehensive solution.
